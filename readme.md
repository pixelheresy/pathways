_A JavaScript Implementation of Pathfinder RPG_

Note:
-----

This initial commit is of the version I built in Dec 2012. This has been in progress since March 2012, albeit on and off. 

This iteration used Backbone Boilerplate, although I will be changing this to Yeoman for package and dependancy management shortly (for tighter version control).

In the meantime, forgive me for my very earliest attempt at learning Backbone, Grunt and Require.js.
